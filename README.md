# code-quiz

This application uses JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS to create a quiz about JavaScript knowledge.
There are 4 questions that need to be answered and completed in 90 seconds. Each correct answer is worth 25 points. Each incorrect answer incurs a 25 second deduction from the quiz timer. (*Currently the code that indicates right or wrong choice is only producing incorrect answers. still a work in progress*)
